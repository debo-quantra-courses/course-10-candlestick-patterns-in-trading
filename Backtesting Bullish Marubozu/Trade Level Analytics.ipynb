    "### Average Trade Duration\n",
    "The average trade duration, also known as the average holding period, is the amount of time you remain in a trade on average. This is important because your capital is ‘locked’ during the time of the trade and cannot be used for other trades. That way it limits the number of trades you can take simultaneously. Hence, limiting your potential to increase profits. Another risk of a long holding period is the release of important news or earning reports. This can violently change the market and may result in a losing trade. We will learn to handle such changes in the risk management section later in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a short holding period is also not favourable, as it results in higher transaction costs and may eat away at your profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the average trade duration we first calculate the holding period per trade i.e. `Exit Date` - `Entry Date`. Next, we calculate the mean of the holding time using the `mean()` method. "
